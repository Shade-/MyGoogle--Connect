### Bug reports

### Development

Although I am just a student, I always support my plugins and try to keep them as up to date as possible. The development branch here on GitHub collects all the changes prior to an official minor or major release. If you feel the plugin is outdated and you would like it to be updated, feel free to open a new issue and hopefully I will accomplish your request as fast as possible.
